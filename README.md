# Angular People Manager

This is a small Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular 7/8 to manage a list of people.  
It has four main views:

- **List all people**
- **Create a person**
- **Edit a person**
- **Delete a person**

The app communicates with REST API endpoints to fetch and update data.  
I used Angular routing for navigation and HttpClient for API calls.

### Features
- View a list of people in a simple table.
- Create a new Person using a form.
- Edit details of a person using a form.
- Delete a person from the list.
- Clean and minimal UI.
